    <h1>Blood Lead Levels in NYC</h1>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>For my Data Journalism Project, I looked at the lead levels in New York City children's blood over a period from 2005 to 2016. The New York City government has put a lot of effort into lead remediation, and this project shows the effects this has had on the health of children in NYC. 
      </p>
      <h2>Working Process</h2>
      <h4>1)Topic</h4>
      <p>Brfore starting this project, I had learned and was familiar with the issue of lead remediation in New York City from a Biology Presentation I did on that topic. I then found a data set that focused on that issue, and started from there.
          </p>
      <h4>2) Designing a Prototype</h4>
      <p>After picking my topic of lead levels in blood, I made a cursory prototype of what my project would end up looking like, and got feedback on it from my peers. <br>
          </p>
      <h4>3) Data Cleansing</h4>
      <p>After receiving peer feedback I narrowed the scope of my project to make it more easily understandable to a first-time viewer.<br>
        I then inmported the data, took the parts I was going to use, then made it into a .json file so it can be read by the program. 
          </p>
      <h4>4) Coding</h4>
      <p>With my peer's feedback on my sketches in mind, I began to work on two different representations of my data. <br>
        The first is a map of NYC that is shaded in with values representing the most recent year in the dataset, 2016.<br> 
        The second is a line chart that shows the progress over time by borough of lead remediation as reflected in blood testing of children living in NYC<br>
          </p>   
      <h2>Prototype</h2>

    </div>
      <p>Design Reasoning: I figured that a good way to represent lead exposure across NYC was to use a shaded map to express the latest data. <br>
      I found this to be the most straightforward way as well one that told an easily understandable story. <br>
      I thought that a line graph showing values over time was the best way to show the city's progress on lead remediation since 2005.
